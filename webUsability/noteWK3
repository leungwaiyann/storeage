***1_user persona_is an archetype or character that represents a potential user of your website or app
***2_scenario_is a situation that captures how users perform tasks on your site or app
***3_storyboard_is a visual representation to teams of how the user would react with your site or app.
1+2+3 will help you to identify key information about your users and build products that will delight your target users 

The Essentials of Interaction Design by Alan Cooper:
-Research users and the problem domain
-Model users and product context: Create user personas, persona-based scenarios
-Define the user, business, and technical requirements
-Define a design structure and flow or design framework
-Refine behaviors, form, and content
-Support development needs

<--Persona-->
Aims:
- a boost in clarity, productivity and success
- enables the designer to focus on a manageable and memorable cast of different kinds of characters, deeply understanding users, prioritize which users are more important
- Build empathy, Develop focus, Communicate and form consensus, Make and defend decisions, Measure effectiveness
What:
- a way to model, summarize and communicate research about people who have been observed or researched in some way.
- is synthesized from observations of many people, designers design for people unlike themselves,
- are implemented in conjunction with other processes, concepts and methods that support and augment their use
- goal-directed design
/************************
Goal-directed design (GDD)
- is a comprehensive design approach that emphasizes the guide of design
- address business needs, technological requirements (and limitations) and user goals

User-centered design(UCD)
- is put user first and meets the needs of users for the ultimate goal

Elements in persona:
-goal, day in the life
How to Create:
- Interview number of people >> find patterns of responses and group similar people tgt >> Create archetypical models >> create user-centered designs >> Share those models to team
Why persona work?
Narrative practice + Long-term memory + Concrete thinking + Theory of mind + Empathy + Experience-taking

<--Scenario-->
Aims:
- explore the context of user interactions and not lose sight of the broader user goals
- refining the system requirements
What:
Scenarios = UCD
Scenarios+ Model users = GDD

<--Storyboard-->
Aims:
- (Think)string personas, user scenarios and various constraints together, see the triggers that occur, the channels that are used, the process that is followed and decisions that have to be made along the way
- (Understanding)bring our solutions to life, so that clients can walk in the shoes of their customers/staff/community, and see solutions as we see them.
- (Understanding)communicate design ideas to teams by using a story, illustrated by something that everyone could see and relate to.
